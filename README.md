## Mystery Ultimates (and variations)
This repository contains the [OSTW](https://github.com/ItsDeltin/Overwatch-Script-To-Workshop) source code for the following Workshop modes:
- Mystery Ultimates [12MET]
- Mystery Everything (Mystery Heroes + Mystery Ultimates) [DH07E]
- Mystery Ultimates Domnioes [KNT1A]

All modes center around the premise that players' ultimate abilities will be randomized upon use (e.g. Reinhardt may get Mei's ultimate).
